# Securing your Raspberry Pi with Ansible

Ansible playbook to secure your Raspberry Pi.
Based on [Securing your Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/security.md)  by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

## What will be achieved by this Ansible playbook?

The playbook will perform configuration modifications in the following areas.

### Raspbian users
* Change the password of the pi user
* Create an alternative superuser
* Make sudo require a password

### Software package updates
* Establish Cronjob to update the openssh-server package on a daily basis

### SSH
* Set users that are allowed to use SSH
* Set users that are not allowed to use SSH
* Establish key-based authentication and disable all other authenticaton methods

### Firewall
* Install & enable ufw and fail2ban
* Set default and ssh firewall rules


## Prerequisites

The following software packages have to be installed on your local machine and the Raspberry Pi.

## Deployment

This chapter describes how to
* get a copy of the project.
* edit the config files.
* run the Ansible playbook to secure your Raspberry Pi.

### How to get a copy of the project

```
git clone https://github.com/tomgelbling/Securing-your-Raspberry-Pi-with-Ansible.git
cd Securing-your-Raspberry-Pi-with-Ansible/
```

### How to edit the config files

Add your Raspberry Pi IP address to the pi host group
```
echo "192.168.2.110" >> hosts
```

Add your public key to the authorized_keys files
```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ./roles/security/files/authorized_keys
```
